List to upcoming and recent Perl Events world-wide

This repository contains a single JSON file that will contain a list of upcomming or recent Perl Events world-wide.

Events will need a event-id, usually one that matches the list of Perl Events on  Act-Conferences.

For each event we need:

- Event Name
- Start and end date in 'human readable' form
- City
- State or Country
- Theme Title
- Logo URL
- Backdrop Image URL
- Backdrop Image overlay
- Backdrop Image overlay intensity

About the assets

The backdrop Image should be roughly 1024x800 pixels
The Logo can be a a SCV or PNG roughly 400x300 pixels

They can be hosted on GitHub, preferably inside a directory, `$eventid`, called logo.svg and backdrop.png
